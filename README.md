kaggle competition numero dos

This is a packing algorithm contest with a twist: there's an unpacking ordering to the presents that are put in the sleigh. The goal is to pack:

(1) All the presents into the smallest z-height possible
(2) Have the presents numbered, in cross-sectional slices from top to bottom, as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. in the order they will be delivered.
